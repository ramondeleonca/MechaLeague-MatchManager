## Highly interactive
The MMS automatically plays sounds at the start of a match, at the start of teleop, at the start of endgame and at the end of the match. Everything can be controlled within the UI, using hotkeys or (WIP) with a Novation Launchpad MK2

## Easy to use overlays
Simply add the overlay as a window capture in OBS, add a croma key effect and enjoy your competition!
